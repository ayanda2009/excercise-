## **Prompt 2: Step-by-Step Guide Creation**

### **Generated Step-by-Step Guide (Prompt 2 Results):**

# How to Master the Priority Scoring System in Task Manager

This comprehensive guide will walk you through understanding and leveraging the advanced priority scoring system in Task Manager.

## Prerequisites

- Task Manager installed (any language version)
- Basic understanding of task creation and management
- At least 5-10 tasks created to see the scoring in action

## Understanding the Priority Scoring Algorithm

The Task Manager uses a **compensatory scoring model** with five key factors:

1. **Base Priority** (10-60 points) - The inherent importance you assign
2. **Due Date Proximity** (0-35 points) - Time-based urgency
3. **Task Status Penalties** (0-50 points reduction) - Work completion stage
4. **Special Tag Boosts** (0-8 points) - Exceptional circumstances
5. **Recent Update Boosts** (0-5 points) - Activity maintenance

## Step 1: Create Tasks with Different Priority Levels

```bash
# Create tasks with different priorities
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Organize desktop files" --priority LOW
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Review team proposals" --priority MEDIUM
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Fix critical security bug" --priority HIGH
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Server emergency response" --priority URGENT

# View the scoring results
python -m TaskManager.cli list --sort priority
```

You should see the base scores: LOW (10), MEDIUM (20), HIGH (40), URGENT (60).

## Step 2: Add Due Dates to See Time-Based Scoring

```bash
# Create tasks with different due dates
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Submit tax documents" --priority HIGH --due 2023-12-01
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Team meeting preparation" --priority MEDIUM --due 2023-12-02
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Code review" --priority LOW --due 2023-12-04
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Plan quarterly goals" --priority MEDIUM --due 2023-12-09

# Check the updated scores
python -m TaskManager.cli list --sort score
```

Time-based bonuses:
- Overdue: +35 points
- Due today: +20 points
- Due in 2 days: +15 points
- Due next week: +10 points

## Step 3: Observe Status-Based Penalties

```bash
# Mark tasks with different statuses
python -m TaskManager.cli update-status [TASK_ID] IN_PROGRESS
python -m TaskManager.cli update-status [TASK_ID] REVIEW
python -m TaskManager.cli update-status [TASK_ID] DONE

# Compare the scores
python -m TaskManager.cli list --sort score
```

Status penalties:
- IN_PROGRESS: No penalty
- REVIEW: -15 points
- DONE: -50 points (effectively removes from active consideration)

## Step 4: Add Special Tags for Circumstantial Boosts

```bash
# Create tasks with special tags
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Production database backup" --priority LOW --tags blocker,critical
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Client presentation prep" --priority MEDIUM --tags urgent
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Regular maintenance" --priority LOW --tags routine

# Check the scoring impact
python -m TaskManager.cli list --sort score
```

Tasks with "blocker", "critical", or "urgent" tags get an +8 point boost.

## Step 5: Combine Multiple Factors

```bash
# Create a complex task
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Fix production security vulnerability" --priority HIGH --due 2023-12-01 --tags blocker,critical,urgent

# Check the total score
python -m TaskManager.cli show [TASK_ID]
```

This task would score:
- Base priority: 40 points (HIGH)
- Overdue bonus: +35 points
- Special tags: +8 points
- Recent update: +5 points
- **Total: 88 points**

## Step 6: Use Scoring for Daily Planning

```bash
# Get your top priority tasks
python -m TaskManager.cli list --sort score --limit 5

# Set up aliases for common commands
alias tm-top='python -m TaskManager.cli list --sort score --limit 5'
alias tm-overdue='python -m TaskManager.cli list --overdue'
alias tm-today='python -m TaskManager.cli list --due-today'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Task Scores Don't Match Expectations

Check all contributing factors:
```bash
python -m TaskManager.cli show [TASK_ID]
```

Look for base priority, due date, status, tags, and recent updates.

### Overdue Tasks Not Getting Highest Priority

1. Verify the due date is actually in the past
2. Check if the task is marked as DONE (-50 point penalty)
3. Look for competing high-priority tasks with special tags

### Special Tags Not Working

1. Ensure you're using exact tag names: "blocker", "critical", "urgent"
2. Check spelling and case sensitivity
3. Verify tags are properly attached to the task

# Task Manager Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### What is Task Manager?
Task Manager is a powerful, cross-platform task management system that helps you organize, prioritize, and track your tasks efficiently. It's available in three programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java) and features an intelligent priority scoring algorithm.

### How do I choose which language version to use?
Choose based on your environment and preferences:
- **Python**: Great for data analysis, scripting, and automation
- **JavaScript**: Ideal for web developers and Node.js environments
- **Java**: Perfect for enterprise environments and Android development

All versions have identical features and can share data files.

### What are the system requirements?
- **Python**: Python 3.7+ and pip
- **JavaScript**: Node.js 12+ and npm
- **Java**: Java 8+ and Gradle

All versions work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Where are my tasks stored?
Tasks are stored locally in JSON format at `~/.taskmanager/tasks.json`. All language versions use the same storage location, so you can switch between implementations without losing data.

## Basic Usage

### How do I create my first task?
```bash
# Basic task creation
python -m TaskManager.cli create "My first task"

# With priority and due date
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Important task" --priority HIGH --due 2023-12-31

# With tags
python -m TaskManager.cli create "Bug fix" --tags urgent,frontend
```

### What priority levels are available?
Four priority levels:
- **LOW**: Base score of 10 points
- **MEDIUM**: Base score of 20 points
- **HIGH**: Base score of 40 points
- **URGENT**: Base score of 60 points

### How do I view my tasks?
```bash
# List all tasks
python -m TaskManager.cli list

# Filter by status
python -m TaskManager.cli list --status TODO

# Show overdue tasks
python -m TaskManager.cli list --overdue

# Sort by priority score
python -m TaskManager.cli list --sort score
```

## Priority Scoring System

### How does the priority scoring algorithm work?
The algorithm uses a compensatory scoring model with five factors:

1. **Base Priority** (10-60 points): Your assigned priority level
2. **Due Date Proximity** (0-35 points): Time-based urgency
3. **Task Status Penalties** (0-50 points reduction): Work completion stage
4. **Special Tag Boosts** (0-8 points): Exceptional circumstances
5. **Recent Update Boosts** (0-5 points): Activity maintenance

### Why did my task score change unexpectedly?
Scores change based on:
- **Time**: Due date proximity changes daily
- **Status**: Moving to REVIEW or DONE reduces scores
- **Updates**: Recent activity provides temporary boosts
- **Tags**: Adding special tags can increase scores

### What tags give special boosts?
Three tags provide +8 point boosts:
- **blocker**: Tasks preventing other work
- **critical**: High-impact, time-sensitive work
- **urgent**: Requires immediate attention

### Can I customize the scoring algorithm?
Currently, the scoring algorithm is fixed to ensure consistency across all language versions. However, you can influence scores through priority levels, due dates, special tags, and task status management.

## Data Management

### How do I backup my data?
```bash
# Manual backup
cp ~/.taskmanager/tasks.json ~/.taskmanager/tasks.json.backup

# Export to different formats
python -m TaskManager.cli export --format json > my_tasks.json
```

### Can I sync tasks between different devices?
Task Manager doesn't include built-in cloud sync, but you can:
- Use cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive) for the data directory
- Set up a Git repository for your task files
- Use file synchronization tools

### How do I migrate from one language version to another?
Simply switch to the new language version - all versions use the same data file format and location. Your tasks will be available immediately.

### What happens if I accidentally delete a task?
Deleted tasks are permanently removed. To prevent accidental loss:
- Use DONE status instead of DELETE when possible
- Maintain regular backups
- Consider using version control for your task files

## Advanced Features

### What is natural language task parsing?
Create tasks using natural language:
```bash
python -m TaskManager.cli parse "Fix critical bug by tomorrow #urgent #production"
```

The system automatically extracts priority, due dates, and tags from your text.

### How does task list merging work?
Merge task lists from different sources:
```bash
python -m TaskManager.cli merge --local tasks_local.json --remote tasks_remote.json
```

Useful for team collaboration or combining personal and work tasks.

### Can I use Task Manager for team collaboration?
While primarily designed for individual use, you can collaborate by:
- Sharing task files through version control
- Using the merge feature to combine updates
- Establishing consistent tagging conventions
- Regular sync meetings to reconcile changes

## Troubleshooting
